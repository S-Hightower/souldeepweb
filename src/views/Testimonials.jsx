                <h4>I just wanted to give a shout-out to the amazing Brenda Martinez for teaching an amazing Reiki class. Immediately I was attuned and trained well enough to preform Reiki on my husband last night that helped fix some issues, and I was able to help my mom with some indigestion today! She thought me how to use my existing intuition to pick up feedback about things going on in the body. And her class was very affordable as well! I highly recommend it</h4>

                <h4>Brenda and I just sat down for a chat and to try out her brand new Emotion Code Reading and Clearing (over Zoom, of course!) Oh my god! The level of detail that Brenda was able to connect with was incredible. As she walked me through the emotions that we were approaching and healing, my body responded so intensely. As a reader, I'm used to connecting intuitively through the readings I receive, but the reactions today where out of this world! If you are feeling a little bit stuck, like you need help releasing or processing, or you just want to feel a bit of lightness and freshness as we work through quarantine, I HIGHLY recommend doing an Emotion Code Reading and Clearing with Brenda.</h4>

                <h4>My husband and I had a profound relationship session with Brenda! She removed blocks from our past lives together and we could feel it so deeply. Before you go off to couples therapy, try this! Your current issues may dissipate as you understand that you are both carrying past life hang ups about each other that you are unaware of and that are affecting you both currently. Powerful way to get off that negative circle pattern thing that plagues a lot of couples. 5 stars!</h4>

                <h4>When I got my readings, I felt like I was communicating with myself over a long period of time. Finding reasons for my patterns allows me to dig into my habits to alter my actions for a better life. One I'm currently in touch with, thanks to Zen1 ..... Better life doesn't say enough Brenda; I'm listening better, communicating more and more confidently. With myself, and with others.</h4>

                <h4>Dear Brenda, Thank you for the Soul Alignment reading you did for me.  The questions I had regarding my life and what I was here to do was answered in the Life Lessons reading you gave me.  It helped me understand what my true task was, and how best I could achieve it. The reading allowed me to truly relax, let go and finally breathe!  It gave me a sense of peace, knowing I was learning what I came here to learn.  The pressure of thinking that I was messing up in some way has gone.  I truly appreciate what a wonderful gift and service you gave to me. Love and Light,</h4>

                <h4>Brenda, I just want to say thank you again for the relationship reading. I have literally listened to it over 20 times and each time gaining more revelation.  I would recommend this reading to everyone! It's helped me to allow my relationship to simply be, instead of trying to make it something it is not.</h4>

                <h4>Brenda is a wonderful teacher. Her Reiki class was the most thorough and hands on experience I have had when seeking to be taught something from another. She was clearly experienced both her in her intuitive perceptual capabilities and her Reiki. Her flexible and clear way of explaining and guiding things made it easy to understand and follow and jump right in with ease. At the end of the class I left feeling satisfied and excited to explore this new aspect of reality. I have been using Reiki every day since. It has only been a couple of weeks since the class but it has already helped multiple people as well as myself. It is such a blessing to be able to take away someone's pain. Its amazing if you think about it, because this is something that blesses you for the rest of your life and as a result and because of its nature it naturally also blesses other people for the rest of your life and even beyond it. I look forward to taking the next class. Thank you Brenda! :)</h4>

                <h4>I am truly very happy and grateful that the Universe brought me Brenda as my Reiki teacher. Brenda is first of all a very sweet soul that is pleasant to be around and learn from. She has a lot of experience and insight into the workings of Reiki and is a very knowledgeable teacher with a personal, intuitive touch. Brenda's level and sharpness of intuition is also impressive and with it I believe she is able to provide her students with a deeper insight into the workings of Reiki. I would definitely recommend Brenda as a teacher to anyone who wants to expand their healing capabilities. Thank you so much teaching us! All the best to you and your family. In Love and Light,</h4>

                <h4>As a fellow Reiki practitioner, I have received Reiki from Brenda in our Reiki practice groups on many occasions and always found it deeply relaxing and beneficial. I enjoy Brenda's calm, positive, joyful presence as well as her considerate and respectful approach to others. She has excellent Reiki skills, and I have often benefited from her intuitive insights.</h4>

                <h4>I have known Brenda for some years now when we attended Reiki practice together. She is warm, compassionate, and intuitive and brings joy to our gatherings. Recently, she did a soul realignment assessment for me that was very informative and which helped give clarity and insight into events in my life as well as an explanation for some of these events.  I was given a clearing and I have felt relief and have come to terms with a lot of these events.  I am able to see how my interests and life path are connected to decisions made previously. Thank you Brenda for these insights</h4>
