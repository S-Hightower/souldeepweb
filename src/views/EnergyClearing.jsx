                    <h4>Emotional Body Release is a combination of Emotion Code, Reiki, Brenda's ability to read the Akashic records - tapping into your past lives, and the past lives of your ancestors - her knowledge of Universal Laws, NLP and much more! The sessions are an effective and gentle way of doing Shadow work. It works on your present issues, as well as issues from your past, past-lives, inner child, as well as your ancestral lineage, depending on what is ready to be released in the current session. </h4>
                <hr />
                    <h4>Emotions sometimes become trapped in our bodies without our knowledge, other times we may be fully aware of the situation involved and the emotion it is bringing up (each session and scenario is different). We as humans process instances through our emotions, be it something that we perceived as minor as a child, or obvious traumatic events. Either way, if we don't fully process it, the emotions become trapped and then live in our body. This can wreak havoc on our entire system - body, mind, spirit, and soul.  It can show up as weight we can't release, headaches, body aches, and most forms of dis-ease, as well as a continued playing out of situations in ongoing relationships.</h4>
                <hr />
                    <h4>Through Energetic Emotional Body Release, we work together to not only find the emotions, but sometimes we may even find a heartwall. Heartwalls are sometimes created to help protect your heart, and are generally there to hide emotions you weren't able to deal with when they happened.</h4>
                <hr />
                    <h4>Through muscle testing via my pendulum, we locate the emotion or emotions that is/are ready to be released and do a dive deep into the cause of, or the starting point of the emotion. This can be like re-living the event, but it's always with the goal of clearing so that you can "feel" better.  By doing this you are allowing healing for yourself as well as helping to change past and future timelines for not only  yourself, but for your family's lineage as well.</h4>
                <hr />
                    <h4>With my psychic and akashic knowledge, I am able to dive deep and uncover many insights to help you connect and understand where and how these emotions have impacted you, so that they can clear in a full and deep manor.</h4>
                <hr />
                    <h4>Another important part of this clearing, is us working together to find what emotions from your higher self are in better alignment with what you want. When you clear something, it's smart to set your intentions to what you want; 
                        <br/>
                        <span>what is in your highest good?</span>
                        <br />
                        By doing this, you clear what is no longer serving you, and replacing it with what will. </h4>
                <hr />
                    <h3>This clearing is always gentle and easy and even though it may bring up old wounds, it is quick and will shift you in beautiful, subtle ways!</h3>
